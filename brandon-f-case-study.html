    <h3>Brandon-f.com</h3>
    <p>During the 2020 corona pandemic, it became more important than ever to have a good presence online. That includes not only the big worldwide organizations but also smaller, independent business and organizations. To reach through the myriad of other players online, you can’t settle for mediocre, you must excel and stand out to be able to get noticed, to get your message through or to sell your products.</p>
    <h4>The problem</h4>
    <p>Brandon Fisichella is an independent historian who creates educational history videos on YouTube and provides guided walking tours about the history of Boston. He has a website where he promotes his services and sells merchandise. The topics are very interesting, and he’s a great storyteller, but his website is homemade and is <strong>lacking many important features for optimising</strong> its final goal; to sell tours and gain an increasing following on YouTube. So I took on the challenge of <strong>redesigning</strong> his website to rise above the competition.</p>

    <h4>The process</h4>
    <p>The first step was to <strong>analyse the current website</strong> to see what features it had and what pros and cons there was to be found. The general structure of the site was fine, but it was lacking a clear <strong>call to action (CTA)</strong>. A visitor could get a lot of information, but they were not pulled into taking any action. It also lacked focus on one of the main channels, YouTube. You could find out about the YouTube channel and its importance by reading on the site, but it was no clear link or button. Apart from that, it had several <strong>UI related issues</strong> (lack of white space, poor image quality, legibility) that needed to be addressed in a redesign.</p>
    <p>TWith a bigger and bigger part of today’s internet traffic coming from mobiles, making the site <strong>responsive</strong> and <strong>mobile-first</strong> was an easy decision. After contacting the owner of the site, and getting his permission to do the redesign (even if he might not use it) I started with creating a <strong>sitemap</strong> and <strong>wireframes</strong>. For testing and feedback purposes I had a small group of potential users that I used as a test group. I tried two versions of the wireframes, in a simple form of <strong>A/B testing</strong>; one with the site divided into several pages, and another as a one-page layout, and my test group preferred the <strong>one-page layout</strong>, due to the simplicity of the navigation.</p>

    <p>After fine-tuning the wireframes according to the feedback I received both from my test group and the site owner I got down to creating wireframes for both smaller and bigger screens. I made sure that YouTube was always present by adding it to the navigation, and I created a <strong>CTA</strong> that takes the users to a form where they can order his paid services. That way both the YouTube channel is present, for <strong>increased growth</strong>, but the real <strong>monetizing</strong> aspect of his services are easily accessible for the visitor.</p>

    <p>I chose to stay true to the original <strong>dark background</strong>, with <strong>light text</strong> and a <strong>red accent</strong>. That way any repeating visitor would still <strong>recognize</strong> themself on the site. I updated and adopted the images as well as the fonts to work better on both <strong>mobile and desktop devices</strong>. The clean colour palette, together with  improved typography, gave the site a strightforward but classy look and feel.</p>
    <h4>Final outcome</h4>

    <p>Finally, I created <strong>high fidelity mockups</strong> for mobile and desktop resolutions that I presented to my test group and the site owner. The <strong>responses were positive</strong> towards my design. Even if the site owner, in the end, opted to not use my designs fully, due to technical issues from his side, he <strong>adopted some of the proposed changes</strong> and added both clear direct links to his YouTube channel as well as a clearer CTA.</p>
    <p>From this project, I learned the <strong>importance of modesty</strong> as your designs might be received in a very positive manner but still be rejected in the end. In this case, the site owner wasn’t able to implement the design in his site since he was limited by his development environment, but he still took in some of the ideas and implemented them in his way. As a designer that might not be a full success, but managing to improve a product in some way is in itself a small victory.</p>
