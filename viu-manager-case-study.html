    <h3>ViuManager</h3>
    <p>While working at All Binary I had the opportunity to <strong>lead the design process</strong> of ViuManager, an online management tool for effectively controlling and managing digital displays. <strong>Collaborating closely</strong> with talented product specialists and developers, our mission was clear: <strong>create a user-friendly</strong> interface that would revolutionise content distribution and device management, ultimately <strong>enhancing the overall user experience</strong>.</p>

        <p>ViuManager was built to manage display and their content.</p>

    <h4>The problem</h4>
    <p>We recognised a significant challenge in the existing process of managing digital displays. Users were struggling with inefficiencies and frustration, as the tools available lacked user-friendliness. It became evident that a streamlined solution was needed to simplify content management, improve workflow, and elevate user satisfaction.</p>
    
    <h4>The process</h4>
    <p>Throughout the design process of ViuManager, our goal was to create an exceptional online management tool for 	digital displays. Here's a glimpse into the <strong>key stages</strong> we went through:</p>
	
		<p>We kicked off the project by engaging in vibrant online <strong>brainstorming sessions</strong> with product specialists and developers. Together, we defined our objectives and <strong>identified the unique features</strong> that would set ViuManager apart from existing solutions. Through the companies close contacts with customers and competitors, we gained valuable <strong>insights into user needs, preferences, and pain points</strong>.</p>

		Armed with user insights, we laid the foundation for ViuManager's <strong>information architecture and interaction flows</strong>. Working closely with the development team, we ensured that the desired functionalities were feasible and aligned with our vision. The visual design phase involved meticulous <strong>attention to detail</strong>, where I created an intuitive and visually appealing interface that embodied the brand's essence and followed <strong>best practices</strong> in usability.</p>

        <p>Choosing a adequate color scheme was part of creating a visually appealing product.</p>
    </picture>
		<p>
		To ensure ViuManager met user expectations, we conducted rigorous internal testing sessions. This involved gathering feedback from stakeholders, product specialists, and developers to refine and enhance the initial design. To validate our design decisions and make further improvements, we engaged in <strong>user testing</strong> sessions.</p>
		<p>
		With the design iterations complete, we reached the moment of truth. The finalised design was handed over to the development team, with whom I maintained close collaboration to ensure a seamless translation of the design into a fully functional product. Witnessing the design come to life was an incredibly gratifying experience, as the development team diligently implemented the design with utmost precision and attention to detail.
</p>    
    <h4>Final outcome</h4>

        <p>The final product in use.</p>
    </picture>
    <p>The design process for ViuManager was a <strong>dynamic journey of collaboration, research, prototyping, 		testing, and refinement</strong>. By putting user needs at the forefront and <strong>iteratively incorporating 		feedback</strong>, we successfully created a powerful online management tool that surpassed user expectations 		and delivered a <strong>seamless experience</strong> for managing digital displays.</p>
		<p>During the process of designing and building ViuManager I led the end-to-end UX/UI design process with passion and dedication. I developed wireframes and prototypes to bring the vision to life and crafted a <strong>visually stunning</strong> and <strong>intuitive interface</strong> that resonated with users. It was also a great lesson in working close with the development team and other stakeholders.</p>
