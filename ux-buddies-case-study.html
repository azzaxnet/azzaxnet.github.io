<h3 id="ux-buddies">UX buddies</h3>

<p>During a year I was studying on IDF, learning about UX, different methodologies, different activities, and ways to create awe-inspiring products, but felt something was missing. Experience. There was no easy and accessible way for a single person, new to UX, to express these newfound ideas and test out their strengths and weaknesses. Yearning for practical knowledge I reached out to an online community to find a solution to his problem.</p>

<h4 id="the-team">The team</h4>

<p>A fellow IDF student responded, saying she has the same pain point. She in her turn found three other members through other groups, so we created a team of five, with a mixed level of experience. My own role was that of a junior designer. Since the group had a truly international composition, with team members in different countries and continents, all our work was done remotely.</p>

<h4 id="tools">Tools</h4>

<div class="images">

    <p>We used Slack for daily catch-ups, Zoom for meetings, Jira, Google Doc and Confluence for project management and documentation, and Figma for design purposes.</p>
</div>

<h4 id="methodology">Methodology</h4>

<p>We used the <strong>design thinking methodology</strong> with <strong>Agile work practices</strong> to allow for routine and confident innovation of the problem space. Each <strong>sprint</strong> was a two-week cycle with standard ceremonies (sprint planning, retrospective, daily catch ups via Slack). We chose this method of working because it is a common methodology in the industry and enables a great deal of flexibility. We considered other flavours of design thinking such as IBM’s model but ultimately chose the design thinking method since we’re all students of IDF, which focuses mainly on that method.</p>

    <p>We worked in 2 week sprints, while adopting the design thinking methodology.</p>
</div>

<p>As we were all working on this project during evenings and weekends, with a fully <strong>remote</strong> team, check-ins were done via <strong>Slack</strong> messages when the need surged. This had the benefits of <strong>flexibility</strong> but sometimes meant that our team would take a few days to align on a collaborative task.</p>

<h4 id="the-process">The process</h4>

<p>To get a deeper insight into this seemingly wide-spread problem, we embarked on a journey of <strong>‘pain-point’</strong> discovery. We starting off our journey with an <strong>initial survey</strong>, distributed to over 100 UX professionals and students, whose responses gave us some early insights. With the results of the survey, we all created individual <strong>assumptions</strong> that were later collectively placed in an <strong>assumption map</strong>, from which we built <strong>hypotheses</strong>. This way of working is a central idea in the <strong>lean UX model</strong>, and the aim is to generate assumptions and hypotheses that can later be <strong>proved right or wrong</strong>.</p>

    <p>Our survey went out to over 100 UX professionals and students.</p>
</div>

<p>Based on the assumptions and our hypotheses we created a common <strong>interview</strong> script that we used when we did individual interviews with 9 volunteers from the survey. Before doing the actual interviews, we tested our script and interview technique through a series of <strong>dry runs</strong>. Once we had scheduled and completed our interviews, we analysed the <strong>transcriptions</strong> to find out the interview highlights and to <strong>test our hypotheses against our interview findings</strong>.</p>

<p>With the <strong>survey</strong>, <strong>interviews</strong>, and of course a <strong>competition analysis</strong>, done, we moved from the <strong>empathy stage</strong> to the <strong>definition stage</strong> of the design thinking process. We all created <strong>personas</strong> based on the common interview finding, which we later used to create <strong>customer journey maps</strong>, <strong>point of view (POV) statements</strong> and <strong>How Might We (HMW) questions</strong>, to define the right challenge to address in the following mode in the Design Thinking process, which is the <strong>Ideation mode</strong>. Good POV and HMW will allow you to ideate and solve the design challenge in a <strong>goal-oriented</strong> manner in which you keep a focus on your <strong>users</strong>, their <strong>needs</strong>, and your <strong>insights</strong> about them.</p>

<h4 id="outcome">Outcome</h4>

<p>Due to personal and professional commitments, our project is put on standby, after a successful empathy and definition run. Our aim is to resume the project where we left it as soon as our whole team is able to dedicate to it again. Since our whole process has been very well <strong>defined</strong> and well <strong>documented</strong>, getting started again should be a smooth process.</p>

<p>My personal outtake from this project has mainly been in the in-depth knowledge of the <strong>procedure of user research</strong>, as well as the importance of having other team members to <strong>brainstorm</strong>, <strong>exchange ideas</strong> and <strong>inspire you</strong>. I also got used of my vast experience in working <strong>cross-culture</strong> and <strong>remotely</strong>, where I, even if being a junior designer, was one of the members that pushed the team forward.</p>
