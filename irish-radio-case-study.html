<h3 id="irish-radios">Irish Radios</h3>

<p>Do you sometimes feel overwhelmed by the millions of songs to choose from on Spotify, or do you feel like not listen to podcasts when you’re cooking or on the bus? Have you ever lived in another country, or do you just have a craze for another culture? Then a simple and easy solution could be to listen to radio from faraway, maybe through an app.</p>

<h4 id="the-problem">The problem</h4>

<p>For me that app was Irish Radios. But even though I got my dose of Irish radio, the app was not perfect so I took on the design challenge to improve its <strong>usability</strong>. The app built on a simple idea, but <strong>the user flow was constantly interrupted</strong> and the design looked outdated. With this redesign, the app would be able to compete better in its segment.</p>

</div>

<h4 id="the-process">The process</h4>

<p>I did the redesign in form of a one-week <strong>design sprint</strong> based on the <strong>Design Thinking methodology</strong>; empathize, define, ideate, prototype and test. By doing this, I managed to improve the app in a quick and efficient way.</p>

<p>The design sprint was done only by me, but with great help from a small group of friends that acted as potential users and gave feedback and critique during the short run of the project.</p>

<p>The project started with some short <strong>interviews</strong> about how, when and why someone would even use a radio app. After collecting the background information I let the interviewees give the existing app a go and I did a <strong>contextual inquiry</strong> where I could observe their pain points and let them react to the app. I decided on doing first interviews and then the contextual inquiries because it was a good way to get the users perceived point of views, followed by the real actions with the product. From this exercise, I found that the users liked that the app was simple and quick to access, but they felt constantly interrupted by pop up messengers. A common pain point was also that the interface looked both dated and “amateurish”.</p>

<p>With this research done, I created <strong>3 proto-personas</strong> and <strong>customer journey maps</strong> to help me define the scope of the redesign. This helped me focus the design on the simplicity of the app and to make it even more accessible and easier to navigate.</p>

<p>During the ideation stage, I used the <strong>crazy-8 method</strong> to quickly come up with ideas for both layout and functionalities that would be used in the later prototypes. One of the pain points, the difficulty to find a specific radio station, would, in the end, be solved with using different ways of sorting the station list, a new feature to add favourites as well as a function to search the stations within the app. All these options were in the end important to have clear and accessible for the user.</p>

<p>From the alternatives made from my brainstorming exercise, I developed a <strong>low fidelity mock-up</strong> in <strong>Figma</strong> that I tested on the users that tried the original app. The response was in general very positive, but I had to make a few adoptions and twists to adopt them to <strong>wireframes</strong> that I used to create a <strong>high fidelity mock-up</strong> (that one also in <strong>Figma</strong>).</p>

    <p>Final outcome of the redesign. The radio station list is always easy accessible, even when you are listening to another station. There is also different ways to find stations as well as an option to save your favourite stations.</p>
</div>

<p>The redesign of the Irish Radios app had a <strong>very positive impact</strong> on the user panel I used during the project. They all found it much <strong>easier to use</strong> and the layout led to a <strong>lower feeling of cognitive load</strong> when the user tested the high-fidelity prototype.</p>

<p>By doing this project without access to real users, the result of the empathize stage will not be as accurate as it could be, but the unison response from my test users make me believe that the redesign would be a strong improvement to the current app. Next stage would be to do real tests on users to show the owner of the app the benefits from implying the changes to their product.</p>

<p>While doing this project I really <strong>strengthened my belief in the usefulness of Design Thinking</strong> as an approach, as it’s a fantastic system for putting the user in the centre and break free from your own biases.</p>
